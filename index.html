        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player can take turn in clicking on the boxes as per their wish</li>
                <li>Each time you click on the box, the board will be updated with the current player's name if the box is not clicked before</li>
                <li>But if the box is already clicked, it will remove the player's name and make it empty where you can click and update your name</li>
                <li>If player "X" is able to fill "X" in three consecutive boxes vertically or horizontally or diagonally, player "X" will win that round</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p># If no one is able to win, ther will be a tie breaking round!</p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>If no one wins in the 3 rounds, there will be fourth round for tie breaking.</li>
                <li> Who ever wins the tie breaking round will win the game </li>
                <li>If no one wins the tie breaking round also, the game will be a draw. Players can play again</li>
